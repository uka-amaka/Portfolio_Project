#### Description:
Nice design of a responsive cs50 restaurant website ðŸ¥— . It contains a header, home, about, services, menu, app, contact and a footer. It also has a fully developed light/dark mode ðŸŒ“ first for mobile then for desktop.
and also a scroll reveal implemented with the use of javascript.
the cs50 restaurant is a static page that shows what cs50 restaurant has to offer its customers.
this responsive website was implemanted using html css and javascripts
the site contains a menu of specail dishes
it also contains a contact us page.
which helps the customers to commmunicate with the resturant his or her problems or satisfaction of the page and can communicate any issues or questions with the page, delivery issues, order issues, and also reservation issues etc could be communicated here
and also if you really want to know about us and were we are located u can visit the about us page.

I'll attempt to tell you exactly how it works. It's quite simple. We have our browser right here, which can be Google Chrome, SAFARI, Firefox.
It doesn't matter. In this browser, we can type into it a website or maybe Google for a website and then click on a website when we click on a website.
What happens is that through Internet, the browser makes a request all the way to another machine.
And this machine, which we call a server, is located anywhere in the world.
It doesn't really matter because, through our Internet network, the browser will say, hey, this website, who owns that website or which machine can serve me the files for that website? And using some complex logic, it's going to find this server, which is just a computer at the end of the day.
We're actually going to see how to deploy our own server. Well, it simply says, hey, give me some data, because, without data, I'm not able to display anything on a webpage.
HTML<CSS<JS is that data between And the server, well, first of all, they communicate over something called HTTP? HTTPS because the browser and the server are two different machines, right? HTTP/HTTPS, which is a secured encrypted version of communication, allows me to access data belonging to a website

So, the request has just been made; this server just happens to have three files that we need.
One is an HTML file :
This HTML file is the text or content of the website.

The other one is the CSS file :
This CSS file contains all the styling of the website. So that is colours, maybe some fonts, maybe the position of the elements, anything to do with style. So, it doesn't look like a boring piece of text.

And then we have JavaScript :
JavaScript is what gives websites behaviour. When I log into Facebook or maybe tweet something on Twitter, JavaScript is allowed me to perform those actions because, with just HTML and CSS, we just have the text and some pretty styling. With JavaScript, we can take action, but we don't need to focus on that too much.
